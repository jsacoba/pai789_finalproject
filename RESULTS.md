## Results and Analysis

### 1. Is there a relationship between EPI and WRI? If there is, are they positively or negatively correlated?;

Yes. Based on the OLS Regression Results below, EPI and WRI are negatively correlated with a correlation coefficient of -0.477. This suggests that on the average, a 1 point increase in EPI is associated with a decrease in WRI by 0.1826 points. Moreover, the coefficient of EPI is significant at 97.5% confidence level. This means that a country's performance in addressing environmental sustainability issues is associated with its risk of becoming a victim of an extreme natural event (disaster).

Also, the results show that around 22.8% of variation in WRI is explained by the EPI.

###  2. What does EPI tell about the exposure and vulnerability of countries to natural disasters?; and

Because WRI is a function of the inherent risk (exposure) brought by physical hazards given the geographic location of a country and its societal framework and structural characteristics (vulnerability), we extend our analysis to determine and dissect which of these WRI components is correlated with EPI.

Based on the results, 





3. What does the location and economic development status tell about their WRI and EPI?
