# Linking Disaster Risk and Environmental Management

## Background

### The World Risk Index

In 2020, the Bündnis Entwicklung Hilft in collaboration with Ruhr University Bochum – Institute for International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict (IFHV) ranked 181 countries according to their risk (World Risk Index or WRI) of becoming the victim of a disaster resulting from an extreme natural event. Topping the list is the Pacific island of Vanuatu which regitered a risk index of 49.79, while Qatar has the lowest risk of 0.31.

As defined by the report, the WRI is the interaction of the countries' exposure and vulnerability. Exposure pertains to the risk faced by various entities such as communities, resources, infrastructure, production, goods, services or ecosystems to physical hazards such as earthquakes, storms, floods, droughts, tsunamis and sea-level rise (Welle, Torsten & Birkmann, Joern, 2015).  Vulnerability refers to the mean of the following three sub-components:

1.	Susceptibility-describes the structural characteristics and framework conditions of a society and indicates the likelihood of suffering from harm in an extreme natural event.

2.	Coping-comprises various abilities of societies to be able to minimize negative impacts of natural hazards and climate change through direct action and the resources available.

3.	Adaptation includes measures and strategies dealing with and attempting to address the negative impacts of natural hazards and climate change in the future. Adaptation, unlike coping, is understood as a long-term process that also includes structural changes.

### The Environmental Performance Index

The 2020 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) report ranked 180 countries according 

The 2020 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) provides a data-driven summary of the state of sustainability around the world. Using 32 performance indicators across 11 issue categories, the EPI ranks 180 countries on environmental health and ecosystem vitality. These indicators provide a gauge at a national scale of how close countries are to established environmental policy targets. The EPI offers a scorecard that highlights leaders and laggards in environmental performance and provides practical guidance for countries that aspire to move toward a sustainable future.

Overall EPI rankings indicate which countries are best addressing the environmental challenges that every nation faces.
