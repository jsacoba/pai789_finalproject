# Linking Disaster Risk and Environmental Management

## Background

### The World Risk Index

In 2020, the Bündnis Entwicklung Hilft, in collaboration with Ruhr University Bochum – Institute for International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict (IFHV) ranked 181 countries according to their risk of becoming the victim of a disaster resulting from an extreme natural event. Topping the list is the Pacific island of Vanuatu with a World Risk Index (WRI) of 49.79, while Qatar has the lowest risk of 0.31.

As defined by the report, the WRI is the interaction of the countries' exposure and vulnerability. Exposure pertains to the risk faced by various entities such as communities, resources, infrastructure, production, goods, services or ecosystems to physical hazards such as earthquakes, storms, floods, droughts, tsunamis and sea-level rise (Welle, Torsten & Birkmann, Joern, 2015).  On the other hand, vulnerability refers to the mean of the following three sub-components:

1.	Susceptibility. This pertains to societal framework conditions and structural characteristics that indicates the likelihood of suffering from harm in an extreme natural event.

2.	Coping. This pertains to various societal capacities to minimize negative impacts of natural hazards and climate change through direct action and the resources available.

3.	Adaptation. These include measures and strategies dealing with and attempting to address the negative impacts of natural hazards and climate change in the future. Adaptation, unlike coping, is understood as a long-term process that also includes structural changes.

### The Environmental Performance Index

The 2020 Environmental Performance Index (EPI) report ranked 180 countries according to their performance in addressing sustainability issues and environmental challenges that they face. It includes 32 performance metrics measures under 11 issue categories. The interaction of these indicator variables are summed up in two main EPI components: environmental health and ecosystem vitality. The report puts: "These indicators provide a gauge at a national scale of how close countries are to established environmental policy targets. The EPI offers a scorecard that highlights leaders and laggards in environmental performance and provides practical guidance for countries that aspire to move toward a sustainable future."

In 2020, Denmark was ranked first with an EPI of 82.5 while Liberia ranked last with an EPI of 22.6 among the countries included in the report.

## Objectives

This analysis seeks to provide data-driven analysis of the relationship between countries' environmental sustainability performance and natural disaster risk. Specifically, this analysis is aimed at answering the following questions:

1. Is there a relationship between EPI and WRI? If there is, are they positively or negatively correlated?;

2. What does EPI tell about the exposure and vulnerability of countries to natural disasters?; and

3. What does the location and economic development status tell about their WRI and EPI?

## Data Handling and Processing

This analysis used `Python` and QGIS in data cleaning, processing and visualization.
