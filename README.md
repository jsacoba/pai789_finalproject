# Linking Disaster Risk and Environmental Management

In 2020, the Bündnis Entwicklung Hilft in collaboration with Ruhr University Bochum – Institute for International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict (IFHV) ranked 181 countries according to their risk (World Risk Index or WRI) of becoming the victim of a disaster resulting from an extreme natural event. Topping the list is the Pacific island of Vanuatu which regitered a risk index of 49.79, while Qatar has the lowest risk of 0.31.

As defined by the report, the WRI is defined as the interaction of Exposure and Vulnerability. Exposure pertains to physical hazards such as earthquakes, storms, floods, droughts and sea-level rise. Vulnerability refers to the mean of the following three sub-components:

1.	Susceptibility-describes the structural characteristics and framework conditions of a society and indicates the likelihood of suffering from harm in an extreme natural event.

2.	Coping comprises various abilities of societies to be able to minimize negative impacts of natural hazards and climate change through direct action and the resources available.

3.	Adaptation includes measures and strategies dealing with and attempting to address the negative impacts of natural hazards and climate change in the future. Adaptation, unlike coping, is understood as a long-term process that also includes structural changes.

The Philippines by virtue of its geographic circumstances is highly prone to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tropical cyclones and floods, making it one of the most disaster prone countries in the world.
